Overview
========
in this study, we propose a Hierarchical ST variational autoencoder (HiSTaR) to extract multi-level latent features of spots. HiSTaR tends to perform well in identifying spatial domains across multiple datasets from diverse platforms, consistently showing superior results compared to existing methods.
